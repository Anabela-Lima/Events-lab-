    <!-- when we press mouse down or ovver an element, we call our coordinates function and pass the event of "mousedown", that is the event
    we also have a few stylistic features: we used a div which is pretty much like a section, we then made it a specific width + height and coloured it blue  -->
    <div onmousedown="coordinates(event)" style="background-color:royalblue; width:450px;height:200px;"></div> 

    <p>
        Click the above div, to display the x and y coordinates of the cursor.
