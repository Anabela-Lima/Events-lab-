        -->



        <!--  The Input element represent a typed data field. This is inside a form tag to allow the user to edit the data. we named this input as "myInput" so that 
               we can use it inside our colour function . 

        we then use the onkeydown event to define the event of the user pressing a key. When this occurs, 
        we call our color() function and pass in the argument of "hotpink". This should change colour of the form i.e the box 
        to hotpink, and upon release, it should change it to blue, as defined by the onkeyup event.  -->

        <input type="text" onkeydown="color('hotpink')" onkeyup="color('blue')" name="myInput">

    </form>
    <p>While typing, when you press a key, the background colour changes to red, when you release the key - the colour changes to green.</p>
