    <h2>JavaScript HTML Events - on mouse move, on mouse out</h2>   <!-- a h2 element with some text inside it -->
    <div id="coordiv" style="width:600px; height:200px; border:1px solid" onmousemove="displayCoordinates(event)" onmouseout="clearCoor()">
    </div>  <!-- we have a div similar to a section, we define the style of the section, essentially just drawing a box with width, borders etc, we then define the onmousemove event (note this is a javascript variable) by equating it to 
      our function- we are basically calling the function and passing in an argument of event. Note that event is not just a variable we've defined, its define by javasscript 
      and will print out a stats e.g. mouse behaviour, etc in the browser. so when we pass in event we get access to all those stats, but our function is what streamlines what we want to extract from that long list of info
      we were just interested in coordinates so defined that in our function using event.x and event.y -- cherrypicking. Lastly the onmouseout, defines what happens when we move away from that box we define-- equating it to clear coor function will call it and clear our coordinates 
     from the coorvalues paragraph  -->
